# Shiny demo

This is a small demonstration of how to use R and Shiny for explorative data analysis using a fluid HTML5 based web browser interface.

This is not supposed to be a full application, but it should contain all components that you need to make the UI and server parts working. Examples of more complete applications:

* tileR, <https://github.com/aheneliu/tiler>. Published in Proc ECML PKDD 2018 (in press).
